# My Personal Project

## Personal Library Application

The **Personal Library Application** will allow users to organize books that they have read or are hoping to read. Users will be able to enter books into a *wishlist* and *read* folder to keep track of their reading habits and books they wish to read in the future. The library will include information about each book’s
- Title
- Author
- Genre

Users will also be able to rate books on a scale of one to five stars that they have read in the library based on how much they enjoyed it.

This library application will be especially useful to users interested in reading and keeping track of their reading habits. Those who enjoy organizing the books they have read and giving ratings based on their opinions of books will be able to use the application to keep track of their books and ratings in one place.

This project is of interest to me as reading is one of my biggest hobbies. This project is a way to avoid writing down information about books in various different places. Instead, I will be able to keep track of books I’ve read and want to read in one place. Additionally, this project allows me and other readers to keep track of what books they enjoyed and what they thought about each book.
